| Information governance | 1.1.1. | You must gather and monitor the information governance requirements needed to fulfil any legal, regulatory and ethical standards. | Requirements will come from a variety of sources including legislation, contractual obligations and ethical standards. Requirements must be monitored to ensure the TRE controls remain appropriate. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.1.2. | You must ensure controls are implemented to ensure the requirements are met. | Control implementation should be systematic and directly aligned to the internal and stakeholder requirements. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.1.3. | You must ensure there are adequate resources to meet information governance requirements. | Ensuring information governance controls are suitable and enforced requires an investment of funding and people appropriate to the size of the TRE. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.1. | You must ensure that changes to policies and standard operating procedures can only be made by trusted individuals. | It is important to ensure that policies and SOPs are relevant, up-to-date and carefully controlled to maintain the integrity and security of your TRE organisation. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.2. | You must use versioning and a codified change procedure for all policies and standard operating procedures. | This includes recording dates of changes, person responsible for carrying out changes, and summary of changes. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.3. | You should measure the performance of information governance within the TRE with regular reporting available to your TRE organisation’s management team. | This may include reports and dashboards showing security incidents, quality management deviations and audit findings. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.4. | You must audit your TRE organisation against relevant requirements and standards. | If you are publicly accredited against a standard, for instance ISO27001, DSPT, CE+ *etc.*, you must have processes in place to ensure you remain compliant. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.5. | You must report on and share outcomes of each audit of your TRE organisation with the required bodies. | This may include regulatory bodies or the organisations that manage accreditations you have. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.6. | You must ensure that suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors with access to your TRE align with your security requirements. | These should be included as mandatory, non-functional requirements in during procurement and contracting. This will also include contractor staff contracts for example, legal liability and NDAs. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.7. | You must monitor compliance of your suppliers with the terms of the contracts. | This will include monitoring changes in the services and infrastructure being delivered and quality management within the contractor’s organisation. This may be done through formal audit or by monitoring change and quality documentation provided by the supplier. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.8. | You must track and maintain any physical assets used by your TRE. | All physical assets should be maintained and covered by warranty if applicable. At the end of their lifetime, assets should be securely disposed of in such a way that data cannot be recovered from them. | Mandatory (where physical assets are in scope) | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.9. | You must log, track and resolve any issues resulting from deviations from processes, incidents and audit findings. | This process could, for example, be tracked through an electronic record and workflow system with records retained. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.10. | You must use reported issues to inform changes, such as for process improvement and risk management. | All issues should be analysed for their root cause and improvements put in place to prevent further occurrence. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.11. | You should collect and maintain quality management data for measuring the effectiveness of a TRE. | Large amounts of data will be produced by elements within the TRE. These data should be analysed with reports and dashboards provided to guide TRE implementer’s improvements and provide re-assurance to data consumers and data subjects. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.2.12. | You could use a QMS (Quality Management System) to standardise and automate quality management tasks and workflows, and to generate quality data and reports automatically. | A basic QMS could be a set of spreadsheets or documents held in a repository which are manually maintained. More mature applications will provide workflows and generate quality data through manual and automated actions. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.3.1. | You must have a way to score risk to understand the underlying severity. | You have a risk assessment methodology for scoring risks on multiple axes such as impact and likelihood. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.3.2. | You must carry out a data processing assessment for all projects requiring a TRE. | A data processing assessment is a process designed to identify risks arising out of the processing of sensitive data and to minimise these risks as far and as early as possible. This may take the form of an existing regulatory requirements such as Data Protection Impact Assessment. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.3.3. | You must have a process for designing, implementing and recording risk mitigations where indicated by a risk assessment. | Actions that are taken or not taken following a risk assessment must be recorded. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.3.4. | You must have a clear set of roles and responsibilities relating to risk including who owns risks and how they are escalated and delegated. | The highest level of risk ownership is the Top Management of the TRE organisation (see Governance Roles). In order to ensure escalations to this level are rare, suitable structures should be put in place to own, mitigate and accept risk. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.3.5. | You must understand the risk appetite of your TRE organisation. | This includes understanding ownership of risk, and ability to accept risk which falls outside of the appetite should that become necessary. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.1. | You must have checks in place to ensure a project has the legal, financial and ethical requirements in place for the duration of the project. | This includes checks that contracts are in place where required, adequate funding is available for the duration of the project, and responsibilities concerning data handling are understood by all parties. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.2. | You must have checks in place to ensure that any time limited compliance requirements are maintained. | This includes ensuring contracts remain in valid and action is promptly taken should they expire. Any changes in the status of responsible persons should also be monitored, for example a data owner leaving an organisation. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.3. | You must have checks in place to ensure that changes in regulations are met for a project. |  | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.4. | You must have standard processes in place for the end of a project, that follow all legal requirements and data security best practice. | This includes the archiving of quality and log data along with the archiving or deletion of data sets. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.5. | You could implement a portal that can provide a workflow engine and database which automates the processes within this capability. | A portal should automate as much of the processes within the capability as possible. Where processes are automated, process maturity is easier to achieve, with more consistent completion and automatic production of quality control and monitoring data. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.6. | You must keep a complete record of all the data assets held within the system. | Details of all data assets (current and past) held by the system should be retained along with meta-data useful for ensuring compliance can be demonstrated. This would include ownership, data lifecycle, contracts, risk assessments and other quality data. This is likely to already exist within the wider organisation but may require augmenting for the TRE. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.4.7. | You should keep a complete record of all the research studies and projects within the TRE current and past. | The study register should contain all data related to a study including a reference to data assets, project team members, information asset owners and any compliance activities required. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.5.1. | You must have a robust method for identifying accredited members of your TRE organisation, prior to their accessing of sensitive data. | This may include ID checks or email/phone verification. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - All TRE entry points rely on Microsoft Entra ID, so you can enforce MFA/Conditional Access before issuing credentials (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Entra ID Identity Governance access packages let sponsors validate identity evidence before users are assigned to TRE Enterprise Apps (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-overview). | - Store the offline ID-proofing artefacts with each Entra access package request to evidence accreditation decisions. |
| Information governance | 1.5.2. | You must have clear onboarding processes in place for all roles within your TRE organisation. | This may include all members signing role-specific terms of use or confirming that they have completed role specific training. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - `make auth` provisions dedicated Entra Enterprise Applications and app roles per TRE role, giving you a structured onboarding path (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Microsoft Entra ID access packages can bundle prerequisite training approvals before a user receives a TRE role assignment (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-overview). | - Capture evidence of training completion or terms-of-use acceptance inside each onboarding workflow. |
| Information governance | 1.5.3. | You must have a set of services to manage access to resources based on identity. | This will include a security model for role based access with technical controls to ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Identity enforcement uses Microsoft Entra ID app registrations per workspace/service via `make auth`, delivering RBAC separation (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Azure TRE user roles map to TRE Admin, Workspace Owner, Researcher, etc., so the API enforces least-privilege scopes (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/user-roles/).<br>- Architecture isolates services per workspace VNet/resource group, so identities can only reach resources they own (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/architecture/). | - Integrate Entra role assignments with organizational joiner/mover/leaver reviews and document Data Controller approvals per project. |
| Information governance | 1.5.4. | You must not give anyone access to datasets without agreement from the Data Controller. | The Data Controller may choose to delegate this authority. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Airlock import/export approvals are limited to workspace owners and Airlock Managers, so Data Controllers can delegate dataset access deliberately (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- The Airlock workflow records every decision for audit, giving Data Controllers assurance that approvals followed policy (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Maintain documented Data Controller delegations and tie them to the corresponding Airlock role assignments. |
| Information governance | 1.5.5. | You must have robust and secure applications in place to authenticate users (and services) within the TRE. | The number of authentication applications should be kept to a minimum with common controls and standards applied across all such as MFA, password complexity *etc.*. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Auth automation provisions confidential clients and relies on Entra-issued tokens so tenant-wide MFA/conditional access applies to all TRE entry points (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Access to UI/API/Guacamole is only over HTTPS behind Azure AD, eliminating local/shared passwords for TRE components. | - Enforce phishing-resistant MFA and conditional access policies plus periodic access reviews in the customer tenant. |
| Information governance | 1.5.6. | You must give each user of the TRE a unique logon with changes to any records strictly controlled. | The unique identifier and all associated records for a user should be traceable across the entire TRE. This will include training records, affiliations, contract agreements and ethics approvals where required. | Mandatory | Supported | - Each user signs in with their own Entra ID identity and is assigned app roles via Enterprise Applications; no shared logons are created (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Role memberships and approvals remain auditable because everything maps to a unique user object ID (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/user-roles/). | - Connect TRE role assignments to HR feeds to auto-disable access when researchers leave a study. |
| Information governance | 1.6.1. | You must determine what training is relevant for all roles within the TRE organisation. | This may include, for instance, cyber security training, GDPR training, and higher level training for system operators. Specialised roles are likely to need more tailored training. Identification of these specialities should be done through a systematic training needs analysis. Specific training may also be required based on the data or information asset owner such as GCP. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.2. | You must ensure that relevant training is available for all roles within the TRE organisation. | All TRE organisation members need to complete all relevant training and keep their training current. You may need to provide help or guidance to enable them to do so. Details of what training is needed will have been determined above. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.3. | You must provide repeat or updated training where necessary to account for changes in competency requirements. | Training is not a one-off event. Electronic reminders for refresher training should be considered. Ideally, training should remain relevant and so policies and processes should enable people to demonstrate competency rather than unnecessarily repeating training. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.4. | You must maintain accurate training records that are directly tied to the role and access levels within the TRE. | Training records should be tied to a user record and carefully maintained. Maintaining training records enables you to ensure all people have completed the required training and that repeat training happens regularly. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.5. | You should accept proof of relevant training certifications from trusted third parties. | You might choose to trust certifications provided by known training providers or your institution’s partner organisations. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.6. | You could have a training platform capable of delivering online training in a variety of formats. | This could be a simple content delivery platform or a more comprehensive LMS platform. It could also include a range of multimedia delivery formats, and accessible training modules for those with access requirements. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.7. | You could implement a learning management system (LMS) to manage courses and deliver training as required. | Where possible an LMS should support a variety of course content and testing. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.8. | You could ensure that any courses you use are available in standard, transferable formats. | Support for standard formats such as SCORM allows courses to be shared between providers. This could help facilitate standardisation of training provision for TRE users across organisations. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Information governance | 1.6.9. | You could keep historical copies of courses in order to demonstrate competency at a given point in time. | Information asset owners and regulators may be required to audit historical records, *e.g.* for clinical trials. It may be necessary to retain copies of superseded training along with versions of certifications within the training record. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.1. | You must not allow users to copy data out of your TRE via the system clipboard. | A TRE user must not be able to copy sensitive data out of a workspace using the system clipboard. A TRE may allow user to paste text into a workspace. This might not be relevant to your TRE, for example if your user interface does not have a clipboard. | Mandatory | Supported | - Guacamole workspace service exposes `guac_disable_copy`, `guac_disable_download`, etc., defaulting to blocking outbound clipboard/file transfer (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/guacamole/).<br>- Deployment guidance shows how admins enforce those parameters when publishing workspace services (https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE/blob/main/docs/tre-admins/setup-instructions/installing-workspace-service-and-user-resource.md). | - Validate any custom workspace services follow the same clipboard/file-transfer restrictions before onboarding. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.2. | Your TRE workspace should provide an environment familiar to your users. | This may take the form of a virtual Windows or Linux desktops, non-desktop interfaces such as JupyterLab and other web applications, or a terminal. Bespoke TRE-specific software should be avoided when widely used alternatives already exist. | Recommended | Supported | - Template catalog ships Windows/Linux desktops plus Azure ML, Databricks, OHDSI, OpenAI, etc., matching familiar research stacks (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/).<br>- Guacamole VMs expose full desktop environments reachable via a browser (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/guacamole/). | - Add additional templates for domain-specific workloads (e.g., CAD, genomics) as demand grows. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.3. | A TRE could restrict data access from data consumers entirely and provide an interface for submitting code. | For example, you might use a system where users submit jobs that run over the data and return results without allowing direct data access. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.4. | Your TRE should be accessed via a user interface accessible using commonly available applications. | TREs which allow users to connect from their own devices should not require the installation of any bespoke TRE application on the user’s device. In practice a web browser is the most common way to achieve this. | Recommended | Supported | - Researchers reach the TRE portal and remote desktops via standard HTTPS browsers; no bespoke client install is needed (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/using-tre/tre-for-research/using-vms/).<br>- Automation integrates through documented REST APIs and Swagger UI (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-developers/api/). | - Perform accessibility/usability testing for the organization’s supported browsers. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.5. | Your TRE must provide clear guidance on how to use software tools and work with data in the TRE. | TREs that provide a virtual desktop environment for data consumers to work in should provide documentation detailing the available tools. TREs where the analysis code is developed on the access machine (as oppose to within the TRE) should provide documentation detailing the mechanism by which code is submitted to the TRE. | Mandatory | Supported | - Researcher guides explain how to create VMs, manage services, and operate inside the TRE (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/using-tre/tre-for-research/using-vms/).<br>- Airlock docs walk Airlock Managers through ingress/egress reviews and manual validation (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/using-tre/tre-for-research/review-airlock-request/). | - Layer organization-specific SOPs, videos, or onboarding sessions onto the published guidance. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.6. | Your TRE should, where possible, automatically apply security related updates for user software. | Reducing the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities in installed software will increase the security of your TRE. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Update Manager can orchestrate recurring OS and application security patches for the Azure VMs hosting workspaces (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/update-manager/overview).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Automanage for Virtual Machines enforces baseline update configurations for Windows and Linux desktops deployed via TRE templates (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/automanage/automanage-virtual-machines-overview). | - Define maintenance windows and validation steps before enabling automatic patch deployment per workspace. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.7. | Your TRE could provide shared services that are accessible to users in the same project. | This may include shared file storage, databases, collaborative writing, and other web applications. This must only be shared amongst users within the same project. | Optional | Supported | - Shared services like Nexus (package proxy) and Gitea (git mirror) are deployed centrally but scoped to TRE projects (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/shared-services/nexus/).<br>- Workspace services/user resources live inside workspace resource groups, so only members of that workspace can consume them (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspaces/base/). | - Document an approval path for enabling new shared services per project/data type. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.8 | Your TRE must ensure that any shared services are only available to users working on the same project. | Poorly designed shared services could enable the unintended mixing of data between projects. To prevent this it is necessary that each instance is only shared between users of a single project. | Mandatory | Supported | - Hub-spoke networking plus `nsg-ws` rules block traffic between workspace VNets, preventing cross-project sharing (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/).<br>- Each workspace has its own Entra application/API, so tokens issued for one project cannot call another’s endpoints (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/). | - Automate periodic NSG/UDR compliance checks within the customer subscription. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.9. | You must mitigate and record any risks introduced by the use in your TRE of software that requires telemetry to function. | For example, some licenced commercial software must contact an external licensing server at start-up. You must be confident that only licensing information is sent to this server and that any network connections are secure. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Outbound internet access is denied by Azure Firewall unless administrators explicitly allow software license endpoints, limiting telemetry exposure (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Network Watcher traffic analytics can log any approved outbound FQDNs, providing evidence of what telemetry leaves the TRE (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics). | - Require vendors to document telemetry payloads and review firewall logs before permitting new endpoints. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.10. | Your TRE must provide software applications that are relevant to working with the data in the TRE. | The tools provided will depend on the types of data in the TRE, and the expectations of users of the TRE. For users working in a TRE via a virtual desktop, this may include programming languages such as Python and R, integrated development environments, Jupyter notebooks, office type applications such as word processors and spreadsheets, command line tools, etc. TREs with non-desktop interfaces should similarly consider carefully which applications are best suited for the data consumers needs when interacting with the data, for example “point and click” GUI tools for querying a database and generating plots of data. The set of tools should be reviewed regularly to ensure they are up to date. | Mandatory | Supported | - Catalog includes Azure ML, Databricks, Azure SQL, OpenAI, Guacamole VMs, OHDSI, etc., covering common data tooling (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/).<br>- Admins can extend templates with bespoke stacks using the documented Porter authoring model (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-workspace-authors/authoring-workspace-templates/). | - Maintain a living map of datasets to recommended workspace services/software. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.11. | Your TRE should provide tools to encourage best-practice in reproducibly analysing data. | Reproducibility of analyses improves auditability and accountability of how data has been used, as well as being best-practice in research. This may include version control software, and tools for developing and running data analysis pipelines. | Recommended | Supported | - Gitea shared service offers an internal git forge for version-controlled code and notebooks (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/shared-services/gitea/).<br>- Templates and deployment automation are stored in Git/Porter bundles, enabling reproducible environment rebuilds (https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE/tree/main/templates). | - Encourage projects to adopt tagging/branching conventions or CI pipelines for reproducibility. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.12. | Your TRE could provide access to some public software repositories or container registries. | For example, a TRE may allow direct installation of packages from Python or R repositories, or provide an internal mirror. | Optional | Supported | - Nexus proxy exposes curated PyPI, Conda, Docker, CRAN, VS Code, etc., letting users install approved public packages without direct internet (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/shared-services/nexus/).<br>- Built-in Linux and Windows Guacamole VMs are preconfigured to use the Nexus endpoints, keeping installs within the TRE boundary (same reference). | - Define governance for onboarding new upstream feeds and monitoring mirror health. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.13. | Your TRE could tightly control which packages are available. | For example, a TRE may only allow installation of a pre-defined set of approved packages. You might also choose to scan for malicious packages and/or go through an approval process before allowing code into the technical environment. | Optional | Supported | - Nexus content selectors/allow-lists let admins restrict which packages and versions appear inside the TRE (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/shared-services/nexus/).<br>- Workspace VNets only reach approved mirrors via the firewall, preventing arbitrary internet installs (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/). | - Implement change control for approving additional repositories or relaxing mirrors. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.1.14. | Your TRE must maintain segregation of users and data from different projects when using non-standard compute. | High performance or specialist compute is often shared amongst multiple users. Users and data must remain segregated at all times.

| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.5. | You should have a development environment that mirrors your production environment which you use to test infrastructure changes before committing them to production. | If possible, you should automate application of changes between development and production environments. Consider the costs and practicality of whether this will work for your situation. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Deployment repo and workflows encourage separate dev/test TRE environments or subscriptions (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/setup-instructions/workflows/).<br>- TRE bundles are versioned so admins can promote tested templates between environments. | - Formalize environment promotion and data migration procedures tied to your SDLC. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.6. | You must have a documented procedure for removing infrastructure when it is no longer needed. | Removing unused infrastructure not only reduces costs and management burden but also reduces the attack surface of a TRE and reduces the risk of unaddressed vulnerabilities. | Mandatory | Supported | - `make tre-destroy` removes core resources and tidies lingering assets to enable clean redeployments (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/tear-down/).<br>- Workspace/service deletion via API tears down associated resource groups and identities automatically. | - Extend teardown SOPs to include data-retention decisions and certificate revocation. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.7. | You should understand the availability and uptime guarantees of any providers that you rely on. | For remote TREs this might include your cloud provider(s) and/or data centre operators. For on-premises TREs, it might be worth using an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) and planning how you would deal with internet outages. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.8. | You should develop an availability target or statement and share this with your users. | Understanding how and when the TRE might be unavailable will help your projects in planning their work. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.9. | Your TRE must control and manage all of its network infrastructure in order to protect information in systems and applications. | Network infrastructure must prevent unauthorised access to resources on the network.

| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.14. | Your TRE must record usage data. | This may include the number of users, number of projects, the amount of data stored, number of datasets, the number of workspaces, etc. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Cost API aggregates per-core, per-workspace, and per-service spend so admins can track active resources (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- TRE UI surfaces cost labels on resource cards, giving visibility into number of workspaces/services in use. | - Augment with activity telemetry (e.g., number of users/datasets) via custom dashboards. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.15. | Your TRE should record which datasets are accessed, when and by who. | This helps maintain auditability of how sensitive data has been used. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.2.16. | Your TRE should record computational resource usage at the user or aggregate level. | This is useful for optimising allocation of resources, and managing costs. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Cost reporting APIs expose per-workspace compute consumption so you can monitor utilization trends (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, data exports plug into Azure Cost Management for deeper usage analytics and forecasting (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/analyze-cost-data). | - Extend collection to capture per-user or per-service telemetry where privacy policies allow. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.3.1. | You must ensure that all projects understand what resources are available and what the associated costs will be before the project starts. | For on-premises systems this might be related to the available hardware, for cloud-based systems there might be limits on how many instances of a particular resource (*e.g.* GPUs) can be used. Projects should use this information to understand whether the available resources will be sufficient for their requirements. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Cost reporting endpoints provide historical spend to inform project estimates before onboarding (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- Workspace templates publish required Azure resources/SKUs so administrators can explain capacity/cost up front. | - Build pre-project estimation worksheets that combine TRE costs with dataset handling fees. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.3.2. | You should ensure that the anticipated needs of projects can be satisfied using available resources. | Note that this does not require you to accept requests for additional resources, but rather that promises made about resource availability before a project starts should be honoured wherever possible. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.3.3. | You must have a procedure for allocating available resources among projects. | For cloud-based TREs this may involve scaling resources, such as virtual machines or databases, or deploying additional resources. For on-premises TREs this may involve a procurement process to ensure that necessary resources are available. Not all requests for capacity increase must necessarily be granted, but having a clear process will help projects understand when/why/how they can make use of additional capacity. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - API + UI gate workspace/service creation behind role-based approvals, giving TRE admins a process to allocate quotas.<br>- Workspace templates allow admins to choose VM sizes, SKUs, and optional services per request (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspaces/base/). | - Add formal capacity/queue tracking outside TRE for scarce resources (e.g., GPUs/HPC). |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.3.4. | You must ensure that the anticipated resource requirements will not result in overspending by the TRE. | For cloud-based TREs this may involve budgeting and/or restricting resource consumption on a project-by-project basis. For on-premises TREs this may involve managing expectations to match the available resource. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Cost APIs + tagging enforce visibility into spend by workspace/service, enabling budgets/chargeback (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- Admins can start/stop core services to control baseline spend (`make tre-stop`/`tre-start`) (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/start-stop/). | - Combine TRE cost data with organizational financial systems for proactive budget alerts. |

| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.4. | You must have procedures in place for rapid incident response. | There may be legal requirements to disclose details of any incidents, such as data breaches for organisations subject to GDPR. Having robust processes in place will ensure a swift and effective response when an incident occurs. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Monitor alerts on metrics and logs from TRE components so responders get rapid signal (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Defender for Cloud raises security incidents for TRE resources, feeding incident response workflows (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction). | - Tie these alerts into the organization’s incident-response playbooks and ticketing tools. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.5. | You should test your incident response through simulation. | During simulated incidents the TRE organisation can measure their effectiveness. This may involve people across the broader enterprise and/or external suppliers. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.6. | You should have an application in place to scan for vulnerabilities across infrastructure. | Software used to identify vulnerabilities should also report and alert. Such an alert should be triaged, risk assessed and treated accordingly. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Defender for Cloud vulnerability assessment recommendations cover TRE VMs, registries, and SQL instances (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-vulnerability-assessment-recommendations).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Defender for Storage malware scanning augments Airlock to detect malicious payloads (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-introduction). | - Define SLAs for remediating vulnerabilities flagged by Defender feeds. |

| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.9. | You should carry out penetration tests on your TRE. | By intentionally attempting to breach their TRE, organisations can proactively discover unnoticed vulnerabilities before they are exploited maliciously. Tests can evaluate the effectiveness of security controls in preventing data breaches, unauthorised access, or other security incidents. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.10. | You should update the security controls of your TRE based on the results of security tests. | Security testing can reveal bugs and discrepancies in the TRE architecture which should be addressed in advance of sensitive data being uploaded, or with urgency in the case of an operational TRE. Regular testing will allow organisations to refine their TRE security controls and incident response capabilities. It enables them to adapt to any new security concerns that may arise as a result of changes in the underlying software. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.11. | You should publish details of your security testing strategy and, where possible, the results of each test. | Knowledge that regular security testing occurs will help to ensure stakeholders, including data consumers and information asset owners, can trust that the data they work with or are responsible for is secure within a TRE. If security flaws are identified in a test, it may not be sensible to publicise these until a fix is in place. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.12. | Your TRE must encrypt project and user data at rest. | This prevents unauthorised access to the data even if the storage media is compromised. This may involve encrypted filesystems or tools to encrypt and decrypt data on demand. The encryption keys may be managed by the TRE operator or by a trusted external actor, for example a cloud provider. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Azure resources (Storage, Managed Disks, Cosmos, etc.) are encrypted at rest by default, and TRE optionally enables customer-managed keys (CMK) in config (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/customer-managed-keys/).<br>- Azure Storage encryption uses platform-managed AES-256 per Microsoft guidance (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption). | - Document key-rotation cadence and ensure logs capture CMK administration activities. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.13. | Your TRE must encrypt data when in transit between the TRE and external networks or computers. | Data encryption must be used to safeguard against interception or tampering during transmission. This includes both data ingress and egress and users accessing the TRE, for example over a remote desktop or shell session. | Mandatory | Supported | - All ingress/egress traffic flows over HTTPS via Application Gateway and Azure Firewall (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/).<br>- Airlock storage SAS URLs use HTTPS and Defender for Storage scanning before data crosses the boundary (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Add TLS inspection/monitoring on enterprise firewalls for extra assurance. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.14. | Your TRE should encrypt data when in transit inside the TRE. | If possible, data transfers between different components of a TRE should also be encrypted. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Internal service-to-service communication leverages Azure VNets/Private Link so traffic stays on the Microsoft backbone (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/).<br>- Shared services such as Azure ML private workspaces can be configured for HTTPS-only internal flows. | - Enforce mutual TLS or IPSec for any custom workload components inside workspaces. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.15. | You should use encryption algorithms and software that are widely accepted as secure. | Encryption algorithms widely accepted as secure today may become insecure in the future, for instance due to newly-identified flaws, or advances in compute capabilities. The latest security patches and updates should be applied to any encryption software being used by the TRE. This helps address any known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the encryption implementation. | Recommended | Supported | - Templates rely on Azure platform cryptography (AES-256) and optionally CMKs, aligning with Microsoft best practices (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).<br>- CMK guidance leverages Azure Key Vault which satisfies industry-accepted controls (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/customer-managed-keys/). | - Periodically review Microsoft cryptography roadmaps and update templates when algorithms deprecate. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.16. | Your TRE should use secure key management. | TREs should employ secure key management practices, including storing encryption keys separately from the encrypted data and implementing strong access controls (*e.g.* Single Sign On) for key management systems. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Keys can be stored in TRE-managed or external Azure Key Vaults with strict access controls (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/customer-managed-keys/).<br>- Azure recommends key management best practices such as role separation and logging (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices). | - Define operational processes for key rotation, dual-control approvals, and HSM-backed keys if required. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.17. | Your TRE could offer physical protection measures against data leakage or theft via physical means. | Restricting access to research facilities containing computers logged into TREs can help prevent malicious actors from viewing or stealing sensitive data, for example by photographing a computer screen. Physical controls on access to a TRE could include surveillance systems, restricting physical access to authorised personnel only, visitor management systems and employee training. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Computing technology and Information Security | 2.5.18. | Your TRE may need to comply with specific regulatory requirements due to the types of data it is hosting. | Regulatory frameworks often emphasise the need for security controls to protect sensitive data. Compliance with these regulations could require organisations to implement specific security measures to safeguard their TRE from unauthorised access. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Azure TRE publishes its baseline compliance mappings so operators understand which regulations are addressed (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/compliance-info/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure provides formal compliance offerings and audit artifacts that can be referenced during TRE accreditation (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/). | - Map your regulator’s control objectives to specific TRE configurations and document any compensating controls. |
| Data management | 3.1.1. | You must have processes in place to assess the legal and regulatory implications of handling the data through its full lifecycle. | This involves considering your obligations to data controllers and subjects, and whether any security controls may be legally or contractually required.

| Data management | 3.1.2. | You should keep records of data handling decisions. | Decisions that are made as part of the process discussed above should be recorded and made available for inspection by all stakeholders. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.1.3. | Information asset owners must classify data sets according to a common process and data classification methodology. | To classify the data, information asset owners must have a good understanding of the datasets and the process of classification. Once classified, data can be stored in a TRE with an appropriate security controls (see later section on security levels and tiering), which can factor in the requirements for confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.1.4. | You must have a data ingress process which enforces information governance rules/processes. | The data ingress process needs to ensure that information governance is correctly followed. In particular, it should require that an ingress request has been approved by all required parties. | Mandatory | Supported | - Airlock import workflow enforces Draft → Submit → Review → Approve states before data enters a workspace (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Review UI/API walk Airlock Managers through manual verification steps (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/using-tre/tre-for-research/review-airlock-request/). | - Integrate organizational IG checklists/approvals via Logic App triggers built on Airlock events. |
| Data management | 3.1.5. | You must have a data egress process which enforces information governance rules/processes. | The data egress process needs to ensure that information governance requirements are adhered to. In particular, it should require that an egress request has been approved by all required parties. | Mandatory | Supported | - Airlock export follows the same multi-stage gate with manual approval, preventing uncontrolled egress (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Export reviewers must confirm policy compliance before outputs reach the approved storage account. | - Extend the process with data-controller specific approval forms or redaction tooling. |
| Data management | 3.1.6. | Egress must be limited to the information asset owners or their delegates. | Egress of data from a TRE must be a specific permission associated with individual users This permission must be given by information asset owners. Egress may still require further approval (see 3.1.5). | Mandatory | Supported | - Airlock allows only workspace owners/Airlock Managers (as delegated by the Data Controller) to approve exports (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Roles are assigned via Entra ID, so approvals can be limited to controller-appointed individuals. | - Record explicit delegation letters outside TRE to satisfy governance bodies. |
| Data management | 3.1.7. | Your data egress process could sometimes require project-independent approval. | There may be cases where there are multiple stakeholders for a piece of analysis including information asset owners, data analysts, data subjects, the TRE operator. A data egress process may then require approval from people not on the project team, for example an external referee or TRE operator representative | Optional | Partially supported | - Airlock’s state machine + notifications can involve additional reviewers by wiring Logic Apps to status events (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- The accelerator does not limit adding project-independent approvers, but customers must define the process. | - Configure automation to notify external referees/data guardians for specified studies. |
| Data management | 3.1.8. | You must keep a record of what data your TRE holds. | Good records are important for ensuring compliance with legislation, understanding risk and aiding good data hygiene. The record should include a description of the data, its source, contact details for the data owner, which projects use the data, the date it was received, when it is expected to no longer be needed. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Microsoft Purview catalogs can register datasets imported via Airlock, capturing ownership and lifecycle metadata (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/purview/overview).<br>- Airlock already tracks request IDs, submitters, and storage locations, providing a baseline inventory of TRE-held data (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Sync Airlock metadata into your enterprise data asset register for full lineage. |
| Data management | 3.1.9. | You must have a policy on data deletion. | There should be a clear, published policy on when data will be retained or deleted. This may allow time for data owners to consider outputs they may want to extract from the TRE. Any sensitive data, including all backups, should be deleted when they are no longer needed. Having clear policies will help to avoid problems with data being kept longer than necessary or accidental deletion of outputs. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Storage lifecycle management rules can automatically expire or move blobs according to retention policies (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts).<br>- TRE teardown guidance covers how to decommission workspaces and shared services, ensuring residual datasets are deleted (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/tear-down/). | - Align lifecycle rules with each Data Controller’s retention and destruction schedule. |
| Data management | 3.1.10. | You should have a method of providing proof of deletion/removal of files. | Information asset owners may require certification of the deletion of files. You should have a method of providing proof of deletion if challenged. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Storage diagnostic logs record delete operations so you can prove when specific files were removed (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage).<br>- Airlock export workflows log the reviewer, timestamp, and final state, providing evidence that outputs were removed or released appropriately (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Forward deletion logs to an immutable log store for regulator-ready attestations. |
| Data management | 3.1.11. | You should log how input data is modified. | If the input data is mutable a TRE should keep records of its modification. For example, when the data was modified and by who. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Purview lineage tooling records when datasets are transformed or overwritten, including the actors performing those actions (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/purview/how-to-lineage-portal).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Storage logging captures blob write and update events for TRE storage accounts (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage). | - Tie lineage events to change-control tickets so reviewers can see why data was modified. |
| Data management | 3.1.12. | You must, to a reasonable extent, prevent unauthorised data ingress or egress. | Movement of data which has not been subject to information governance processes risks breaking rules and is more likely to result in a data breach. However, it is difficult to control for every possibility. For example, a user may take pictures of their computer screen to remove data, or use a device presenting as a USB HID keyboard to input large amounts of text. An example of a reasonable measure would be for a remote desktop based TRE to prevent data being copied from a local machine’s clipboard to a workspace. | Mandatory | Supported | - Workspace GUIs disable clipboard/download by default and all ingress/egress must use Airlock containers (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/guacamole/).<br>- Azure Firewall denies outbound traffic unless explicitly allowed (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/). | - Add user awareness and monitoring for attempted policy bypass (e.g., screen capture tools). |
| Data management | 3.1.13. | Data held within the TRE should be the minimum required for analysis or research. | Data stored and processed within the TRE should be limited to the amount required for that purpose. This increases the level of protection for data subjects, makes it easier to comply with data protection legislation and could reduce the overhead of storage and processing. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.2.1. | You must not create user accounts for use by more than one person. | It is important that each user account should be used by one, and only one, person in order to facilitate the assignment of roles or permissions and to log the actions of individuals. | Mandatory | Supported | - Auth is entirely Entra ID-based; TRE never provisions shared accounts (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Workspace roles are assigned per-user, ensuring accountability in audit logs. | - Enforce policies that forbid shared credentials in customer SOPs and audit Entra assignments regularly. |
| Data management | 3.2.2. | You must be reasonably convinced of the identity of each person being granted an account. | It is important to ensure an account has been given to the correct person. For example, multiple credentials may be used before account creation to verify identity or, when appropriate, photo ID checks may be required. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Entra ID Identity Governance workflows can require approvers to validate identity evidence before granting TRE access (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-request-policy).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Microsoft Entra ID Protection can flag risky sign-ins, prompting additional verification before credentials are issued (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/overview). | - Document the manual ID checks (e.g., HR verification, ID scans) that accompany each access package approval. |
| Data management | 3.2.3. | You must restrict a user’s access to only data required in their work. | There is no need to grant an individual access to data they do not require. Access may be assigned in a manner appropriate to a TREs design, for example through roles granted to user accounts or through isolated project workspaces. | Mandatory | Supported | - Workspace access is limited to users added to the corresponding app role or security group, enforcing least privilege (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Network isolation plus RBAC ensures users can only reach datasets deployed to their workspaces (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/). | - Implement periodic access reviews for each workspace and document data-owner approvals. |
| Data management | 3.2.4. | You must ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all users. | Multi-factor authentication ensures that to successfully connect a user must have more than one piece of evidence in different categories. Categories include something the user knows (*e.g.* a password), something the user possesses (*e.g.* a TOTP key) or something the user is (*e.g.* biometric data). A TRE does not need to implement multi-factor authentication checks itself if it is provided by a third-party identity provider. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Authentication rides on Microsoft Entra ID, so you can enforce tenant-wide MFA/Conditional Access for all TRE apps (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Microsoft Learn documents recommended MFA options that tenants can enable centrally (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks). | - Mandate MFA/conditional access policies for every TRE Enterprise Application and monitor compliance. |
| Data management | 3.2.5. | You could use federated authentication or single sign-on (SSO) for user login. | Institutions that use a SSO for other applications may wish to extend this login capability to a TRE. This will simplify the login process for data consumers using a TRE and prevent them having to remember or store multiple login credentials. | Optional | Supported | - TRE relies on Microsoft Entra ID SSO, so researchers sign in with the same enterprise credentials used elsewhere (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/plan-sso-deployment).<br>- The `make auth` automation registers TRE API/UI as standard Entra enterprise applications (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/auth/). | - Federate additional identity providers (e.g., academic IdPs) if cross-organization studies are expected. |
| Data management | 3.2.6. | You could restrict access to particular networks or physical locations. | Restricting access to a set of known, static, personal or institutional IP addresses can help avoid speculative attacks. When appropriate, access could also be restricted to physical locations with security controls and access requirements. | Optional | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Conditional Access policies can restrict TRE Enterprise Apps to trusted named locations or compliant devices (https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/location-condition).<br>- Azure Firewall plus forced tunneling ensures workspace traffic only traverses approved network paths (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/networking/). | - Coordinate with your security team to codify the list of permitted IP ranges and geographies. |
| Data management | 3.3.1. | You should have a system to help classify outputs. | Removing data from a TRE can be a difficult process as there is potential for sensitive data to be revealed. Having guidance, processes and methods will help ensure that outputs are correctly classified and, furthermore, that outputs due to be openly published are identified. Encouraging openly published outputs will enhance a TRE’s impact and transparency. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.3.2. | You should establish the intended outputs of each project from the outset. | Identifying the purpose of a piece of work is important for compliance with data protection legislation. Results will be produced which address the project’s purpose, some of which may be outputs that are removed from the TRE. Understanding what these outputs are likely to be and their sensitivity as early as possible will help prepare for their processing and publication. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.3.3. | You must have a documented process for disclosure control of outputs from the TRE. | This process should define expected risks and how to mitigate them. All TRE outputs must be subject to this process. You might choose to follow existing guidelines, for example around statistical disclosure. | Mandatory | Supported | - Airlock mandates manual review of every export/import, functioning as the documented disclosure-control process (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Malware scanning + review states ensure identified risks are mitigated before approval. | - Capture statistical disclosure rules/checklists used during Airlock review in organizational policy. |
| Data management | 3.3.4. | You must have a process for assigning responsibility for output checking. | Output checkers should be given responsibility for checking outputs. They must follow your disclosure control process and will be responsible for any automated parts of this process. Output checking can help mitigate against unintentional data disclosure or leaks. | Mandatory | Supported | - The Airlock Manager role is assigned per workspace, explicitly owning approval responsibilities (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/user-roles/).<br>- API records each reviewer’s identity and decision, preserving accountability. | - Assign backup reviewers and document escalation paths for urgent outputs. |
| Data management | 3.3.5. | You must have a documented policy for handling disclosure risks associated with any outputs that cannot be manually checked. | Some categories of output, for instance binary files or very large numeric files, can be difficult to manually check. If egress of such files is permitted then the risks of inadvertent disclosure must be mitigated and documented. Refusing to allow egress of such files is also a valid policy decision. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Airlock can block or quarantine files that cannot be adequately reviewed (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Customers must define which file types are unacceptable and how to evidence rejection. | - Extend Airlock policies/scripts to auto-detect file categories requiring additional mitigations. |
| Data management | 3.3.6 | You should have a statistical basis to guide the decisions of an output checker on the safety of outputs. | There should be a solid basis to allow decisions to be made about data based on risk factors such as re-identification of an individual or risk to commercial operations posed by outputs from the TRE. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.3.7 | You could create a semi-automated system for checks on common research outputs. | Automation helps make decisions on outputs more consistent and reduces the overhead for output checkers. It’s unlikely however that a fully automated output checking system (without humans in the loop) would be appropriate, given the risks associated with accidental data disclosure. | Optional | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Airlock events + storage automation can be extended with Logic Apps to perform scripted checks before reviewer approval.<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, malware scanning with Defender for Storage already automates part of the review (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Build additional automated checks (statistical tests, metadata scans) triggered by Airlock status changes. |
| Data management | 3.3.8. | TRE outputs should be limited to the minimum required for sharing results of any analyses. | This decreases the risk of inadvertent disclosure, and makes it easier to comply with data protection legislation (e.g. GDPR). | Recommended | Supported | - Airlock enforces that only reviewer-approved files leave the TRE, keeping outputs to the documented minimum (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/).<br>- Workspace architectures encourage researchers to keep raw data internal and only export summaries/graphs. | - Provide guidance/templates for acceptable output types per data classification. |
| Data management | 3.4.1. | You should provide a metadata catalogue of available datasets for users. | This is particularly relevant for TREs with population-level data collection of general interest. This may not be appropriate for TREs where each project has its own data sharing agreement with one or more data provider or very sensitive datasets. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Microsoft Purview can expose searchable metadata catalogs without giving researchers direct dataset access (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/purview/overview).<br>- Airlock metadata and workspace templates provide descriptive context that can be surfaced to prospective users (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/airlock/). | - Curate user-friendly catalogue views filtered by permissible audience. |
| Data management | 3.5.1. | You must be able to specify what categories of data your TRE is able to support. | Your TRE must provide an explanation of the kinds of data it has been designed to hold, with reference to its security capabilities, that can be understood by all stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders may include information asset owners and project teams and they may have different levels of technical expertise. | Mandatory | Partially supported | - Azure TRE ships restricted vs. unrestricted workspace templates so operators can align security controls with data sensitivity (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspaces/unrestricted/).<br>- Architecture docs describe the security controls (firewalls, Airlock, identity) that underpin each tier (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/architecture/). | - Map organization data classifications to the provided templates and document required extensions. |
| Data management | 3.5.2. | Your TRE could support projects with differing security requirements through configurable security controls. | This allows projects with different security requirements to each be met with a suitable level of controls. It helps ensure that users can work effectively, with minimal barriers. | Optional | Partially supported | - Workspace templates expose parameters for NSGs, firewall rules, and workspace services, letting you tailor control strength per project (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-workspace-authors/authoring-workspace-templates/).<br>- Base workspace template guidance shows how to add or remove services to meet varying requirements (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspaces/base/). | - Maintain a decision tree so requestors land in the correct template variant automatically. |
| Data management | 3.5.3. | Your TRE could offer a pre-defined set of security control tiers. | Security control tiers can be designed to cover the types of project or data you expect to handle. Projects may be placed into the most suitable tier rather than having a bespoke design. This reduces the number of unique configurations that need to be supported. | Optional | Supported | - The solution already provides Restricted, Unrestricted, and Dedicated workspace template tiers with distinct controls (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspaces/unrestricted/).<br>- Administrators can publish additional Porter bundles to introduce new standard tiers without bespoke engineering (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-workspace-authors/authoring-workspace-templates/). | - Document which datasets map to each tier and the approval needed to move between them. |
| Data management | 3.6.1. | You should have a consistent and easily accessible meta-data data model or similar to describe what a data asset contains. | Where possible, existing data models should be employed (and extended if necessary). More detailed information on the data schema for data assets should also be provided to assist researchers in understanding what data may be available without the need to see the underlying data. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Purview business glossary and schema features let you describe datasets in a consistent metadata model (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/purview/overview).<br>- Workspace templates can include custom parameters/metadata that describe the datasets they host, aiding discoverability (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-workspace-authors/authoring-workspace-templates/). | - Extend the glossary with domain-specific vocabularies and require authors to populate it during Airlock import. |
| Data management | 3.6.2. | You could provide summary, abstracted or synthetic data to researchers without exposing the underlying data set. | To reduce the need for access to row level data researchers could be provided with non-sensitive versions of the data either as summary data or using synthetic versions of the data for activities such as code development and cohort planning. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.7.1. | You could provide an interface application for data consumers and data subjects to query elements of the data. | In order to make data findable, an application which queries the meta-data or elements of the research data could be made more easily accessible than the data itself. | Optional | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Data management | 3.8.1. | Archived data within the TRE should be read only. | Archived data by its very nature should not change and therefore be maintained as a read only store. If an update is required, it may be pulled from archive into a separate operational store. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Immutable Storage for Azure Blob enforces write-once-read-many policies so archives stay read-only (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-storage-overview).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Storage RBAC and ACLs can present archival containers as read-only to TRE workspaces (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/security-recommendations). | - Define procedures for temporarily unlocking archives when regulators require updates. |
| Data management | 3.8.2. | Long-term archives must be held in simple, standard formats to ensure accessibility. | Some data archives may be required by policy or legislation to be kept for very long periods within the scope of the TRE. Such data should be held in the simplest possible file format, conforming to international standards if available, to ensure they are platform and application agnostic. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 stores data using open, analytics-friendly formats like Parquet and CSV (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).<br>- Workspace template parameters can mandate export formats for archival datasets (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-workspace-authors/authoring-workspace-templates/). | - Publish a format catalogue that aligns each dataset type with its archival file standard. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.1.1. | You should have a business continuity plan that includes consideration of loss of service for deployed TREs. | This may be due to downtime from service providers, a breach, or loss of power. Your plan should detail your process for managing loss of service for deployed TREs, and evaluation of impact of such loss. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.1.2. | You should regularly test the aspects of your business continuity plan concerning TREs, and have a process in place to iterate the plan if required. |  | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.2.1. | You should ensure that all projects using your TRE have a named project manager. | The project manager has responsibility to ensure the smooth running of the project. Their responsibilities may include budget management, tracking TRE status, managing communications with the TRE operations team, and other project support tasks. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.2.2. | You should not give project managers direct access to the TRE. | Doing so ensures a separation between those able to access sensitive data, and those overseeing access to sensitive data. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.3.1. | You must document all features of your TRE implementation. | This includes ensuring all documentation is discoverable, clear, and able to be easily updated based on stakeholder feedback | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.3.2. | You should have an education programme in place to upskill stakeholders in the use and management of your TRE. | This may include learning modules, workshops and other resources on how to effectively access and use a TRE, FAQ pages, and accessible pathways for additional support | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.3.3. | You should periodically carry out a training needs analysis (TNA) for all stakeholders included within your TRE provision. | At least once every 12 months you should assess the training needs of your stakeholders, and ensure they have easy access to all required training materials | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.4.1. | You must ensure that all projects using your TRE are aware of any associated costs and are able and willing to pay them. | Costs may include provision of the underlying TRE infrastructure, additional resources required in a specific TRE (for instance memory or additional compute), hardware including managed devices, and staff support costs | Mandatory | Partially supported | - TRE cost reporting surfaces estimated monthly charges before a workspace/service is provisioned (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Cost Management budgets can be shared with project teams so they understand spending ceilings (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/budgets). | - Include TRE cost projections in project initiation documents for formal acknowledgement. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.4.2. | You should be able to track the costs associated with each TRE project. | This includes knowing which costs are associated with which project, and having an appropriate charging mechanism in place in line with your organisational policy. | Recommended | Supported | - Cost APIs break down spend per workspace/service/user resource, satisfying chargeback requirements (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/).<br>- UI cost labels show ongoing month-to-date spend, helping project managers monitor budgets. | - Integrate API data with finance systems for automated invoicing or recharge models. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.4.3. | You should have a process in place to ensure your TRE provision remains financially sustainable. | This could include having a cost recovery process in place, or setting up a long-term funding mechanism to support projects with TREs. At any given time, you should have funds free to cover all potential foreseen TRE provision for at least 12 months. | Recommended | Partially supported | - Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Cost Management best practices help TRE operators plan reserve capacity, chargeback, and forecasting (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-best-practices).<br>- Cost reporting APIs provide the detailed usage data needed to build recovery models (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/azure-tre-overview/cost-reporting/). | - Pair Azure telemetry with organizational finance tooling to prove 12-month funding runway. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.4.4. | You should minimise the cost of your TRE infrastructure wherever possible | You should have regular reviews of your TRE provision and actively work to bring down costs, streamline provision, and optimise support. | Recommended | Partially supported | - TRE administrators can stop or start shared services to minimize idle spend when projects pause (https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-admins/start-stop/).<br>- Not part of accelerator; however, Azure Cost Management recommendations highlight savings plans, rightsizing, and idle resources to optimise spend (https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-best-practices). | - Review cost reports regularly and capture resulting optimization actions in change records. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.5.1. | You must identify any goods or services that will be needed to operate the TRE and ensure that a plan is in place to purchase them as needed. | These may include computing hardware, cloud credits or devices through which users access the TRE. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.6.1. | Your TRE must have a team of Operators in place to support projects working with TREs. | This may be part of your organisation’s IT support team, or separate. Responsibility should be clear and stakeholders should easily be able to access support appropriate to their needs. | Mandatory | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.7.1. | You should have a clear process in place for stakeholders to feedback on your TRE infrastructure. | This may include a GitHub repository where people can open issues and discussions, communication streams like Slack or email, or forms stakeholders can fill in. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.8.1. | All public engagement activities must include a range of perspectives and be inclusive (*optional for TREs without personal data). | Any public engagement activity carried out by TREs should involve diverse participants and that activities are accessible. Recruitment plans should consider how to proactively reach a representative sample of people or target particular groups of people where relevant This could include following guidelines such as PEDRI. | Mandatory* | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.8.2. | Details of TRE operations, data available and projects which have accessed the data should be publicly available (*optional for TREs without personal data). | TREs should be as transparent as possible by providing information online. Where information is made available online this should be written in clear language understandable to general public. A record of projects which have accessed data via the TRE should be kept and made available. Where possible it should include name, summaries, public benefit (if relevant) and organisations involved | Mandatory* | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.8.3. | Members of the public should be included in TRE operations and/or oversight (*optional for TREs without personal data). | Members of the public can be involved via presence on steering groups or project approvals panels. Alternatively TRE’s can establish separate public panels available for both researchers and TRE staff to consult. | Mandatory* | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.8.4. | You should publicly share details of incidents, near misses, and mitigations in a timely fashion, in line with good practices for responsible disclosure. | This may be via the TRE website or annual reports. Sharing this information is particularly important when a TRE holds public sector data. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.9.1. | You should identify areas where legal advice may be required and ensure that you have ready access to it. | It is likely that legal advice will be necessary for several issues around the handling of sensitive data, and managing project contracts. TRE operators should have ready access to legal advice, including a way to solicit advice and carry out associated actions. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.9.2. | You should identify areas where advice on data protection issues may be required and ensure that you have ready access to it. | It is likely that data protection advice will be necessary for several issues around the handling of sensitive data. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
| Supporting Capabilities | 4.9.3. | You should identify who will be responsible for managing contracts related to the TRE. | These contracts may include data sharing agreements, secondments of personnel or limitations on how results obtained with the data can be distributed. | Recommended | N/A (customer control) | - Not applicable as an accelerator | - Customer must implement policy/process for this control. |
