./devops/scripts/aad/aad-app-reg.sh \
  --name "${TRE_ID}" \
  --tre-url "https://${TRE_ID}.${LOCATION}.cloudapp.azure.com" \
  --admin-consent --automation-account
```

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `--name` | The prefix of the name of the app registrations. `TRE` will give you `TRE API`. |
| `--tre-url` | Used to construct auth redirection URLs for the UI and Swagger app. Use the values of the [environment variables](../environment-variables.md) `TRE_ID` and `LOCATION` in the URL. Reply URL for the localhost, `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/oauth2-redirect`, will be added by default. |

### Enabling users

For a user to gain access to the system, they have to:

1. Have an identity in Azure AD
1. Be linked with an app registration and assigned a role

When these requirements are met, the user can sign-in using their credentials and use their privileges to use the API, login to workspace environment etc. based on their specific roles.

The users can also be linked via the Enterprise application view:
